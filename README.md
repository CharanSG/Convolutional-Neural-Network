# Convolutional-Neural-Network
Development of computer vision framework based on deep learning and  GPU programming. We designed a convolutional and a fully connected neural network for object recognition in images. The training of the network and the computation of its output run on GPU, programmed with OpenCL and C++. The algorithm developed during a diploma thesis.
